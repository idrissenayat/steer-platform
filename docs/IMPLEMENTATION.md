# STEER platform implementation

This branch implements the Phase 0 kit and a Phase 1 local pilot against a
rebuildable fixture connector.

## Implemented

- deterministic artifact-chain projection and dropped-event reconciliation;
- role-aware decision inbox with conditional specialist seats and SLA state;
- Gate 1 intent/spec comparison, Gate 2 exam review, and Gate 3 evidence view;
- revision-safe sign and send-back actions that bind identity and sequence;
- continuous work-item thread from brief through evidence and signatures;
- guided non-engineer brief authoring with deterministic validation/revision;
- an interview-first originator experience with rendered draft correction,
  context-resolved system names, and no raw artifact exposure;
- a three-surface role home ordered as decision inbox, triggered candidates,
  and ambient flight, with a WIP-gated Product Lead intent backlog;
- an in-place rendered intent-detail panel with revision-safe actions,
  provenance evidence, clusters, history, and outcome instrumentation;
- a repository-sourced Learn STEER hub with version-aligned canon pages,
  section search, glossary peeks, stateless role orientations, and agent slices;
- a live scope check for one outcome, one exam, and one coherent shape, plus
  plan-sprawl alarms and split guidance;
- P85 cycle-time forecasting and aging-band domain functions;
- pilot telemetry for wait time, centralization, and human effort;
- Phase 0 templates, gate policy, guardrails, bands, metrics, culture, seams,
  and an EXAM-protection hook;
- webhook HMAC/replay controls, scope audit, log scrub, and ephemeral assistant
  retention control;
- automated structural accessibility and performance checks; and
- a self-hosted static container with security headers and health endpoint.

The source for this behavior is `STEER-Sizing-and-Scoping.docx` (Practice Note
1). Its rules are mirrored in `kit/policy/sizing.json` so the platform and the
adoption kit enforce the same operating model.

`STEER-Providing-Intent.docx` (Practice Note 2) defines the intent interaction
model. Its no-invention, ambiguity-surfacing, rendered-draft, correction, and
identity-binding rules are mirrored in `kit/policy/intent.json` and the guided
interview domain.

`STEER-The-Three-Surfaces.docx` (Practice Note 3) defines the intent/work-item
pull boundary and protected attention hierarchy. Its candidate controls,
measurable-today rule, decay record, WIP refusal, and notification boundaries
are mirrored in `kit/policy/surfaces.json` and the intent-backlog domain.

## Current boundary

The browser preview uses the fixture connector and pilot identities. It proves
the interaction and domain contracts without requesting credentials or making
external writes. Production completion requires an approved signature policy,
OIDC configuration, a live code-host/CI connector, specialist manual
accessibility evidence, and pilot outcome data. See `INTENT-COMPLETION.md`.

## Local commands

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm check
pnpm dev --port 4175
```

`pnpm check` validates the adoption kit and CI scopes, typechecks, runs the
gauntlet, and produces the production build.
